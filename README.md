# KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship - Sprocket Central Pty Ltd Project

Welcome to the KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship! This project offers you a unique opportunity to gain practical insights into the work done at KPMG and to develop essential career skills and experience.

## Introduction

In this virtual internship, we collaborate with Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes and cycling accessories organization. They have approached KPMG's Lighthouse & Innovation Team, seeking expertise in analytics, information, and modeling. The project is divided into three key tasks, each addressing crucial aspects of data analysis.

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment

In the initial phase, we conduct a thorough assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd provided us with three datasets:

1. Customer Demographic
2. Customer Addresses
3. Transactions data from the past 3 months

Our goal is to perform comprehensive data exploration and identify opportunities for enhancing the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd's data.

## Task 2: Data Insights

In this task, we focus on targeting high-value customers based on their demographics and attributes. We create a recommendation using a detailed approach that encompasses three phases: Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation. The approach involves activities such as understanding data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, and reporting.

## Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation

The final task involves presenting insights using visualizations. We develop a dashboard using Tableau that showcases a data summary and the results of our analysis. During the presentation, we address critical business questions, including:

- Identifying trends in the underlying data.
- Determining the customer segment with the highest customer value.
- Proposing marketing and growth strategies for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd.
- Identifying additional external datasets that could provide deeper insights into customer preferences and purchasing behavior.

Join us on this exciting journey as we delve into the world of data analytics and make valuable contributions to Sprocket Central Pty Ltd's business strategies.
